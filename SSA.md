**Society**: Statistical Society of Australia

**Representative**:	Adrian Barnett

TOPIC FOR REPORTING THIS QUARTER (June 2020): *Indigenous engagement*

*Key issues for Board discussion (covering any topic)*

* _None_

*Key issues for noting only (will be taken as read)*

* Some of our members have expressed deep concern about the lack of statistical input to the current scientific discussions on COVID-19 at a federal government level. STA have been helpful in passing on our concerns. The pandemic has highlighted problems with how important research and expertise gets the attention of government.

* We made a statement in support of the Black Lives Matter campaign and received lots of positive feedback, but some negative feedback too.

**Indigenous engagement**: Nothing to report. 

*Cluster representative to choose two nominated topics of interest to the cluster to report on*

*Cluster-nominated topic #1*: *COVID crisis*

* It has been great to see lots of online meetings replacing our usual face-to-face branch meetings. Lots of members who cannot normally get to face-to-face meetings have been able to join in online, which has been an unexpected benefit and something we hope to retain.

* Like many societies we had to postpone our 2020 national conference. We are aiming to have a range of online events during the time the conference would have been on.

* The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) should be commended for their rapid response to COVID-19 and the great amount of new data collections and reports they have created, see https://www.abs.gov.au/COVID-19. 

*Cluster-nominated topic #2*: Membership

*	We introduced a “perpetual membership” option so that members over 50 years old could pay a one-off fee and be a life-time member.
