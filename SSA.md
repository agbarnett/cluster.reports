*Cluster representative to choose two nominated topics of interest to the cluster to report on*

*Cluster-nominated topic #1*

*	**Engagement with the region - Asia Pacific**. We have decided to have our 2022 conference in Darwin. The aim is to have a "Joint Southern Statistical Meeting" (JSSM) to rival the JSM in the northern hemisphere. We aim to invite societies from the region and have already had positive responses from Indonesia, The Philippines and New Zealand. We are open to suggestions from colleagues about what societies we should invite.

*Cluster-nominated topic #2*

*Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion*

* We will launch the inaugural Betty Allen travel award in November. This is a female-only award of $3000 to be used for travel. The award is in partnership with Data-61.
