* **Indigenous engagement**. Nothing to report. 

*Cluster representative to choose two nominated topics of interest to the cluster to report on*

*Cluster-nominated topic #1*: *COVID crisis*

* It has been great to see lots of online meetings with some large audiences from our branches across the country.

* The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) should be commended for their rapid response to COVID-19 and the great amount of new data collections and reports they have created, see https://www.abs.gov.au/COVID-19. 

*Cluster-nominated topic #2*: Membership

*	We introduced a “perpetual membership” option so that members over 50 years old could pay a one-off fee and be a life-time member.
