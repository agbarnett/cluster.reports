**Society**: Statistical Society of Australia

**Representative**:	Adrian Barnett

TOPIC FOR REPORTING THIS QUARTER: *STEM policy priorities*

*Key issues for Board discussion (covering any topic)*

* _None_

*Key issues for noting only (will be taken as read)*

* We've again experienced phishing scams via email with scammers sending emails asking members to urgently send money to cover society events. 

*Cluster representative to choose two nominated topics of interest to the cluster to report on*

*Cluster-nominated topic #1*: *Early career members*

* We created a new "Fellowship funding award" scheme to conditionally award $3000 to up to eight early career researchers who are applying for ARC or NHMRC fellowships. This is a competitive scheme with a short application form. 

* We renamed our "Young Statistician" section to "Early Career and Student Section" after feedback from members that they felt excluded as they were not "Young", even though our aim was that "Young" included people who were young in their statistical career.

*Cluster-nominated topic #1*: *Membership*

* We ran an online media training workshop for members with _Science in Public_ that was very successful with over 100 attendees.

Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion

* We will soon be putting together a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion committee.
