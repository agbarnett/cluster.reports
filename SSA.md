**Society**: Statistical Society of Australia

**Representative**:	Adrian Barnett

TOPIC FOR REPORTING THIS QUARTER (February 2020): *Engagement with the Asia-Pacific*

*Key issues for Board discussion (covering any topic)*

* _None_

*Key issues for noting only (will be taken as read)*

* Last year we created two vice-president roles, one for membership and one for communications. This has been a very succesful initiative because both VPs have been energetic in their roles and made multiple positive changes.

* We've had a long debate about using a Professional Conference Organiser (PCO) or not for our next conference. We've had some issues with PCOs in the past in terms of high costs and sometimes slow response times. On the plus side they do have a lot of experience and it could be a big risk to "go it alone", although this would allow us to keep registration costs down.

**Engagement with the region - Asia Pacific**. Our 2022 conference will be in Darwin. The aim is to have a "Joint Southern Statistical Meeting" (JSSM) to rival the JSM in the northern hemisphere. We aim to invite societies from the Asia Pacific region and have already had positive responses from Indonesia, The Philippines and New Zealand. 

*Cluster representative to choose two nominated topics of interest to the cluster to report on*

*Cluster-nominated topic #1*: *Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion*

* We launched the inaugural Betty Allen travel award in November. This is a female-only award of $3000 to be used for travel. The award is in partnership with CSIRO/Data-61. We had 14 applications many of which were outstanding, and we awarded two prizes.

*Cluster-nominated topic #2*: Membership

*	We had four members at Science Meets Parliament and they all reported thoroughly enjoying the two days.

* We are considering offering a life-time membership option for members aged 50 and above.
